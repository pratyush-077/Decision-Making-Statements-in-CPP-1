In this experiment, we explored how C++ handles decision-making using if, if-else, else-if, nested if, and switch statements. These control structures help the program make choices based on conditions, which is a fundamental part of any real-world application.

We wrote programs that take user inputs and apply logic to produce different outcomes based on conditions. This gave us hands-on experience with branching logic and helped build a foundation for writing interactive and responsive programs.

EXPERIMENT 5A
This program checks whether an integer entered by the user is odd or even using the modulus (%) operator. If a number is divisible by 2 (num % 2 == 0), it's even; otherwise, it’s odd. This is a simple example of condition checking and introduces the concept of using arithmetic operators in if-else logic.

EXPERIMENT 5B
In this program, the user inputs three numbers, and the program uses nested if statements to compare them and find the greatest one. Nested conditions help break down complex decisions step-by-step. This improves understanding of how to handle multiple comparisons and logical flows in programming.

EXPERIMENT 5C
This program checks whether a given character is a vowel or a consonant. It compares the character against all vowels (a, e, i, o, u – both uppercase and lowercase). If it matches, it’s a vowel; otherwise, if it’s an alphabet, it’s a consonant. This helps practice logical OR conditions and character input handling in C++.

EXPERIMENT 5D
This program takes a number (1–7) from the user and uses a switch statement to print the corresponding day of the week (e.g., 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.). If the input doesn't match any valid case, a default message like "Invalid input" is shown. This helps understand how switch-case handles multi-option choices more cleanly than multiple if-else blocks.

EXPERIMENT 5E
In this program, the user enters two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /). A switch statement then performs the correct operation based on the operator. This program is a practical example of using switch-case to control program flow and also strengthens understanding of arithmetic operations and user interaction.

EXPERIMENT 5F
This program simulates a very basic ATM interface using a switch statement to handle three key banking operations: checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money. It starts with a preset balance and allows the user to choose an operation by entering a number. The use of conditional checks ensures valid amounts are processed, especially during deposits. though minimal and a small program this helps us understand about how menu driven programs are made using various switch cases
